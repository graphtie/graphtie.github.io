I am a Black woman scholar. My research centers the precarious nature of American citizenship experienced by People of Color, remedies violent erasures, restores visibility, and highlights Black and Brown freedom struggles. Currently, I am pursuing my PhD Student in Writing and Rhetoric at Northeastern University.
