title: Why (Black) Citizenship? Building a Rhetoric.
---
​
Black Lives Matter. This is an unequivocal truth, and yet, the very notion that Black people's lives are equal to our counterparts remains highly contested particularly in the United States. The rejection of Black humanity and right(s) to live is a question of citizenship, and a prime example of how a predominantly white colonial nation-state finds more comfort in separation and exclusivity than in equity. Simply, we need a Black rhetoric of citizenship because Black lives and experiences matter. And, systemic oppression and antiBlackness don't stop just because the rest of the world decides to stop paying attention. 

In building a Black rhetoric of citizenship, I've had to take considerable steps in revising rhetorical theory in order to reconfigure understanding of citizenship as not simply national, but sociocultural. In sum, I believe that when we begin to think of citizenship not simply as a "status" bestowed upon individuals by the State (which, effectively, creates literal and figurative borders that allow for current and past zeitgeist's violent practices of Othering) and instead as a "sense of belonging" shaped by cultural belonging, we can reach across boundaries of race, gender, sexuality, and nationality. Thus, we would be left with social understanding of citizenship (broadly) and how the specific moniker(s) of citizenship become malleable in the hands of various publics. Research can then examine the ways in which citizenship is a performance: how it may be possessed, confirmed, displayed, and/or rejected.

I foresee my study of citizenship as a work in decolonization, both of the Academy and, more broadly, idealistic characterizations of the American Union. I mine the political efforts of local, state, and digital communities of Color in order to  remedy violent erasures, restore visibility, and highlight Black, Brown, and Indigenous freedom struggles. Harm can never truly be undone; nevertheless, it is my hope, that my small effort will make the work of Black, Brown, and Indigenous people visible.
